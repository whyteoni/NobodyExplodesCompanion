# NobodyExplodesCompanion

_A companion to Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, the popular VR title._

It's a fun game, no doubts there. However, it can get frustrating to look up information and do tedious mental gymnastics. While many people may say that this is sort of the point of the game, beyond improving/destroying communication skills between two peoples, I chose to dissent. This  is for a few reasons. The first is that my bomb defusal partner is exclusively my spouse, and as such I would like to not be responsible for repeated failures followed by an inevitable (__pun warning__) blow up. Secondly, I am a nerd and believe technology is there so that we only have to think about something once, devise a contraption/application to dal with it, and then we can go about our lives without ever spending a single thought on it again.
